## About
Veritas.AI is built to accelerate and strengthen the truth-seeking workflow for journalists, platforms, researchers and public institutions. It is designed to scale across languages and media types, while keeping every verification decision explainable and auditable.

---

## 1. What We Plan to Build
Veritas.AI is a multi-agent, hybrid verification intelligence platform that validates and updates the authenticity of news, images, and videos in real time.

Core capabilities:
- 🧠 Multi-Agent System: Specialized agents analyze text, images, video, metadata, and sentiment in parallel.
- ⚙️ Hybrid Verification Loop: Fast automated checks with human escalation for ambiguous/novel claims.
- 🔍 Trace-the-Source Graph: Visual mapping of where information originated, how it transformed, and how it spread.
- ⭐ Agent & Source Reputation Scoring: Dynamic trust scoring to weight evidence and agent outputs.
- 🔄 Dynamic Truth Ledger: Automatically re-verifies and updates previous verdicts when new evidence appears.
- 🧾 Explainable Reasoning: Every verdict includes sources, reasoning, and provenance.

---

## 2. Pain Points Addressed
- ❌ Static verification: Facts change; Veritas re-checks continuously.
- ⚠️ Opaque systems: Full transparency with explainable decision trails.
- ⏳ Slow manual verification: Parallel multi-agent checks cut latency from hours to minutes.
- 🧩 Lack of accountability: Human-in-the-loop ensures ethics and responsibility.
- 📉 Declining trust in media: "Verified-by-Veritas" badges restore audience confidence.
- 📰 Source bias & unreliability: Dynamic reputation scoring adjusts credibility automatically.

---

## 3. Target Audience
- 📰 Media Houses & Newsrooms — Fast, auditable verification for breaking news.
- 🧑‍💻 Independent Journalists — Affordable assistant tools for small teams and freelancers.
- 🌐 Social Platforms & Aggregators — Real-time misinformation filtering via API.
- 🏛️ Government Agencies — Monitor and counter false narratives during crises.
- 🎓 Universities & Research Institutes — Datasets and dashboards for misinformation research.

---

## 4. Core Components & Architecture

High-level components:
- Ingestion Layer: Capture text, links, images, video, metadata, and social traces.
- Multi-Agent Processing Engine:
  - Text Agent: Claim detection, knowledge-base cross-checking, citation extraction.
  - Image Agent: Metadata, reverse-image search, tamper and manipulation detection.
  - Video Agent: Frame analysis, deepfake detection, audio-forensics.
  - Sentiment & Context Agent: Detects framing, emotional cues, and context drift.
- Orchestrator & Escalation Engine: Routes uncertain cases to human verifiers and coordinates agents.
- Trace-the-Source Graph DB: Stores provenance, transformation links, and diffusion paths.
- Reputation & Scoring Engine: Agent reputation, source trust graph, and verdict confidence.
- Dynamic Truth Ledger: Stores time-series verdicts and triggers re-verification jobs.
- API & Integration Layer: REST/gRPC endpoints, webhooks, browser plugin, and dashboards.

## 5. Getting Started (Quickstart)

Prerequisites (example):
- Python 3.10+ and/or Node 18+
- Docker (recommended for reproducible environments)
- Git

Development quickstart (example commands)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Vignesh-Kamsala/Veritas.AI.git
cd Veritas.AI

# Optionally run with Docker
docker compose up --build

# Or create a virtualenv and install
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the API service (example)
./scripts/start_api.sh
```

Note: The repository currently contains the conceptual design and initial scaffolding. Implementation details, environment variables, and service-specific guides will be added as code modules are developed.

---

## 6. Example Verification Flow

1. Ingest incoming claim (text / URL / image / video).
2. Agents run parallel checks (KB search, reverse image, metadata analysis, deepfake checks).
3. Orchestrator collects agent outputs and computes confidence using reputation weights.
4. If confidence >= threshold → publish verdict, log provenance, emit webhook.
5. If confidence < threshold → escalate to human verifier with full audit trail.
6. Verdicts are appended to the Dynamic Truth Ledger and trigger notifications if earlier claims must be updated.

Sample API usage (pseudo)
```http
POST /api/v1/verify
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "article",
  "source_url": "https://example.com/news/123",
  "content": "<raw_text_or_media_reference>"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "verdict_id": "v123",
  "verdict": "mixture",
  "confidence": 0.72,
  "sources": [ "...list of supporting/contradictory sources..." ],
  "provenance_graph_url": "/graph/v123",
  "explanation": "Reasoning summary..."
}
```
